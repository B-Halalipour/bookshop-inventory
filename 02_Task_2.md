# Create a books table

You will need a place to keep a record of all the books that are in stock. Each book will need the following:

- book_id (How can we make sure this will be unique?)
- title
- price
- quantity_in_stock
- release_date
- is_fiction


Again, make sure that you can run this file more than once without issue. If not - what can you do to resolve this?

Consider an appropriate data type for each column. You can find suggestions of data types in both the [notes](https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/sd-notes/back-end/#sectionId=psql,step=postgresql-data-types) and the PSQL [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html). 

> Hint: if you have made a new file, connect to your database so that the table is made in the correct location.
