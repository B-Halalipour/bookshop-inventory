# Query the books table

Make some queries to find out some information about the books you have.

Write a query to list each of the following:

- The books that we have in stock.
- The non-fiction books.
- The books released in the 1900s.
- The books with "the" in the title.
- All of the books sorted in alphabetical order.
- All of the books sorted from most to least expensive.
- The most expensive book.
- The books that are in stock and are under £7.
- The books that are under £6 or are non fiction.

> Hint: You may want to consider how you're going to lay out these queries in your files. You could comment out complete queries, or look into echo statements to give you a nice title should you pipe the output to a file.
