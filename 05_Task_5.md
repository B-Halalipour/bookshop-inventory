# Delete some books

There are a few books that have been added to the table that are not in stock. Delete them with a single `DELETE` query (not by altering the data added in task 3)!

How could you write the query to show you the removed rows?

> If you want to run the deletions multiple times to test them out, the data may need to be reset. If you have made multiple files, remember that they will need to be executed to recreate the database and tables.
