# Advanced Tasks

> hint Some of these tasks will use methods that we haven't covered today. You'll need to use the docs, notes or some good old fashion research to solve them.

1. The store has had a delivery of 20 new copies of the most popular books, update any book in stock with a stock count under 15 to account for the 20 new copies.

2. We need to mark up any book released in December for the Christmas rush. Any book with a release month of 12 should cost an extra Â£2.50.

3. In the advanced folder of your repo you'll find a sql query for another books table. This table has duplicate entries for Pride and Prejudice in the table. We need to have unique rows to accurately reflect stock. Total up the quantity in stock for all copies and update just one of the rows, then remove the duplicates from the table.
