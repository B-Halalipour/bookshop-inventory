# Create an authors table

The bookshop owner is very happy with your work so far! Because it's going so well, they have a few more requirements for you!

As it stands, the database isn't storing any information about the book's authors.

We need to add this information to the database without duplicating any information.

Each author will need an author id, an author name and, as the owner is a big fan of trivia, a place to store a fun fact about the author.

For our purposes, let's assume that books are written by a single person. 

In a larger database we could most certainly have authors that have written more than one book meaning that our database would contain a one to many relationship. You can read more about these relationships [here](https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/sd-notes/back-end#sectionId=foreign-keys-and-joins,step=intro).
